        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          myFlix is a web application, developed using the MERN stack. (MongoDB,
          Express, React, and Node.js) The app provides users with the ability
          to create an account, giving them access to a list of movies, their
          directors, and genres. Users are able to update their personal data
          and add or remove movies on a list of their favorites.
        </p>

        <h2>Purpose and Context</h2>
        <p>
          myFlix was a required project built during my web development course
          at CareerFoundry that demonstrates my Full-Stack skills.
        </p>

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
          The aim of the project was to gain a deeper understanding of both
          frontend and backend development with JavaScript-based technologies,
          as well as bringing the frontend and backend together to create a
          Full-Stack web application to add to my portfolio.
        </p>

        />

        <h3>Server-Side Implementation</h3>
        <p>
          For the server-side, I created a RESTful API using Node.js and Express
          that accesses a noSQL database (MongoDB) via common HTTP methods. The
          database uses CRUD operations for manipulation and provides data for
          movies in JSON format.
          <a href="https://my-flix-db-akc.herokuapp.com/documentation">
            View Documentation</a
          >
          To test the API, I used Postman. I also included user authentication
          and authorization code in the form of basic HTTP authentication and
          JWT authentication.
        </p>

        <h3>Client-Side Implementation</h3>
        <p>
          After completing the API, I began building the interface users would
          need when making requests to and receiving responses from, the
          server-side. It is a single-page, responsive application, developed
          with React and React-Redux.

          <li>
            Registration view: Allows new users to register (username, password,
            email, birthday).

            Login view: Allows users to log in with a username and password.
          </li>
          <li>
            Main view: Returns a list of ALL movies to the user (each listed
            item with an image, title, and description), allows for sorting and
            filtering, includes the ability to select a movie for more details.
          </li>
          <li>
            Movie view: Returns the data (description, genre, director, image)
            about a single movie to the user and allows users to add or remove a
            movie on their list of favorites.
          </li>
          <li>
            Genre view: Returns data about a genre, with a name and description.
          </li>
          <li>
            Director view: Returns data about a director. (name, bio, birth

        <h2>Challenges and Learnings</h2>
        <p>
          Given that this was my first project built using React, it took me a
          bit of time to get accustomed to React's structure and in particular
          the use of state across components. With the help of my tutor and
          after multiple pair-programming sessions with an experienced
          developer, I was able to really learn React and complete myFlix.
        </p>
        <p>
          While working on the server-side I quickly became familiar with using
          the terminal. I enjoyed building the API and learning database
          structures. I think one of the more important things I learned through
          my challenges with React, aside from the technology, was that you
          can't give up on a project when things get difficult.
        </p>

        <h2>Duration</h2>
        <p>
          I started building myFlix September 2022 and finished November 2022.
          The majority of that time was spent on the client-side, really
          learning the way React and React Redux work.
        </p>
